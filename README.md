Explain differences between Java vs JavaScript

- Java is a Object-oriented programming language that focuses on creating objects and transfer data around with object.
- Java is a statically typed language; JavaScript is dynamic.
- Java is class-based; JavaScript is prototype-based.
- Javascript is a scripting language that is optimized for a run-time environment, meaning it does not need to be compiled.

Explain generally about node.js and NPM

- Node.js is an event based, asynchronous I/O server side platform
- Node.js is a server side platform which can execute JavaScript and therefor not a Javascript framework

- NPM is a package manager for Node.js with many different packages, which you can include in your Node.js based projects.

Explain about the Event Loop in Node.js

- The event loop is used to handle asynchronous request without having to block your program.

Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools Babel and WebPack, using examples from the exercises

- Babel is used to compile ECMAScript 6 to ECMAScript 5. This allows you to use ES6 features becuase they will be compile into ES5 if a browser doesn't support ES6.
- Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. good Webpack notes
